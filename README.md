# CannyEdgeDetection
Edge detection is defined as identifying points in an image that has massive discontinuities, texture changes, and brightness changes. Images that have one of these three characteristics are typically edges of a surface on an image. For this project I chose to attempt Canny Edge detection - created by John Canny who decided upon creating a smoothing filter that would best fit the criteria of detection. He attempted and showed that first order derivatives of Gaussian functions would approximate his desired ideal filter accurately. There are general criteria for an optimal edge detection that John Canny hoped to fulfill. As with anything, a process with a low error rate was needed, the edge detector had to be accurate to be useful. To steer away from a redundant process, any edge in an image should be calculated once, where noise should not create inaccurate, or even false edges. To do this, it is stated that John Canny used the calculus of variations, using functionals - which can be defined as a linear mapping of a vector space.
